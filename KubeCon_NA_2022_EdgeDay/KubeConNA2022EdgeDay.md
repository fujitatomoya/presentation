- Using upstream mainline as architecture.
- Probably all kubernetes feature would not be required to edge use cases.
- Workload should be adjusted such as AI models during drone flying.
- [Redhat Device Edge](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/device-edge)
  - 100% Open Source / Supported
  - ARM 64 supported (2GB / 2 cores / device)

- high-performance machine-independent byte code.
- expecting use case for far edge devices such as AI processing.
- lightweight container compared to linux container such as docker.
- extreme resource constrained platform, image size is pretty small.

- Wasm can be future of serverless computing instead of typical FaaS as JavaScript and Python.
- AI interface as FaaS for future.
- also comes with easy deployment and management.
- constrained interfaces would be the situation against regular container. for example, complicated application using network or distributed system cannot be supported.
- Reference
  - [wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/introduction.html)
