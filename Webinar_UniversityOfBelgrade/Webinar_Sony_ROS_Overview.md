# [Open Source Robotics Alliance](https://osralliance.org/)

- The OSRA is the last step in a yearlong process to move ROS, Gazebo, Open-RMF, and Infra to an independent non-profit organization. 
- OSRA is currently seeking members, both individuals and organizations to financially support the ROS infrastructure and its development.

# Why Open Source matters?

- **Network Effects / Feedback Circles**
  - Value increases based on size of use cases
  - Bigger community, more ideas, variety of experience and skills
  - Standard API / Interface, Collaboration / Presence

- Open Source is the new “Standard”: Linux is the `standard` Operating System

- **Cost Effective**
  - Only specific part of product is `differentiating` feature

# Let's just jump in ROS Community

- 1st, let’s do it! We can always ask for the help!
- Be constructive, productive and inclusive! Let’s say “we”!
- Respect, nobody works for free. (Don’t ignore feedback)
- But trust needs to be earned.
- Solve community problem, not only yours.
- Worldwide community / different culture.
